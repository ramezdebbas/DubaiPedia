Mosques are scattered through out the mainland of Dubai. The resonating echo of the ‘adhan’ resounds through the still air of Dubai five times a day from the mosques. This is the call for Muslims to come to the mosque and pray. Streets are flooded with devoted worshippers on Friday afternoon when the Jummah prayers are held as they make way towards the mosques. Thus the local shops and stores open around 2pm after the prayers are over. However, large retail outlets and grocery stores open at the usual time.  Although Arabic is the official language, people speak English as well. some common words are ‘shukran’ meaning thank you, ‘la’ meaning no, and ‘naam’ meaning yes.",
